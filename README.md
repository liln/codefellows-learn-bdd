Code Fellows: Rails Bootcamp
====================

Example code from Day 1.

A few different types of tests are included here, as examples.

 * A specification for a simple ruby class
   * [step-by-step blog post is available](https://gist.github.com/ivanoats/6833823)
 * A specificaiton for a simple web page
 * A specificaiton for a popular web service
 * A specificaiton for a newly-created Rails app

Try getting the tests passing with your own code!

Hints:

 * spec_helper.rb will set you up with MiniSpec.
 * Use the serve.rb script to easily get local html content browser-accessible.
 * You'll need more than 1 local webserver running to pass all specs.

Have fun!
